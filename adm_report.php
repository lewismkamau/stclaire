/* Module Description
** This module illustrates use of the SELECT command which is used
** to read data from the database. in this case, the data is read 
** from the admission table and embedd into html 
** to make the admission report viewable by the user.   
** The connection and the data are defined in separate modules,
** and incorporated using to this code using the 'include'. the
** alternative is write all the code in one file. 
** ---------Please Note------------
// ** for this module to work without modification:
** 1. your web and SQL server must be running
** 2. Files must be hosted in the server
** 3. Fields MUST have names similar to those in the admission table
** 4. Your connection object MUST have the same database attributes like those in dbconnection.PHP
** --------Customization------------
** You can customize this files to fit your system if you understand the workings.
